### Project Description

We designed an application to enable drivers to publish their dash-cam videos via YouTube to our database. 
Logged-in users can post, rate and comment on various drivers in their community to enable safer driving for everyone. 
Future add-ons will enable publishing by simply taking a picture or via talk-to-text features.
