### Project Description

We designed an application to enable drivers to publish their videos (currently via YouTube) to our database. 
Logged-in users can post, rate and comment on various drivers in their community to enable safer driving for everyone. 
Future add-ons will enable publishing by simply taking a picture or via talk-to-text features. 

### Key Elements and Features

- View updated dash-cam videos with geo-location
- Google Maps API call for location info
- Facebook and Google log in authentication and authorization 
- Most popular tagged videos in our dataabase are sorted, stored and displayed
- Optional input form for adding to the database
